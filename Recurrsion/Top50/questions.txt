Q1 You are given an integer n. Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops.
Ans : intution : 

The last call before hitting the base case is what triggers the “unwinding” of the recursion.
All the earlier calls are paused, waiting for the inner calls to finish.
Once the base case is reached, each paused call resumes in reverse order, executing the System.out.println (or print) statements.
For n = 10:
      printAscending(10) → waits
              printAscending(9) → waits
                        printAscending(1) → calls printAscending(0) → base case reached → returns
        

          Now printAscending(1) prints 1
          Then printAscending(2) prints 2
              …

Finally, printAscending(10) prints 10

Part 2 : Deceding way 
                  Tail recursion: you do the action before the recursive call.
                  This means the current number is printed immediately, and the recursive call handles the smaller problem afterward.
      In tail recursion / descending order:
            There’s no priority given to the recursive call.
            The function first executes whatever comes first in the code — in this case, System.out.print(n).
            Only after printing does it make the recursive call to handle the smaller problem (n-1).

Q.2 . Print n to 1 without loop

Q3 Recursion Use it and find the mean of the array: => 
==>> 
Input: 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The sum of elements (15) divided by the number of elements (5) gives the mean: 3
: intution neeed the sum first then divide by the total number of element 
Q4 Find the sum of firest N numbers using recursion 
      Intution: First cheack the base case if the base case hit then return otherwise untill an dunless call the functinon recursively and try to get the sum for the sum of that index and less than that one more
