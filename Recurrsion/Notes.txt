                                                                                      Recursion & Backtracking

Concepts to cover:
              Recursion tree & base cases =>> Backtracking pattern (choose → explore → unchoose)
    Why important: 
              Forms the mental base for DP, tree traversal, N-Queens, and permutations.
Key problems:
                        N-Queens
                        Subset generation
                        Rat in a maze / Path finding

What is Recursion? 
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type and calling itself with updated parameters until it reaches a well-defined base case.
