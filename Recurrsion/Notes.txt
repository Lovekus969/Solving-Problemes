                                                                                      Recursion & Backtracking

Concepts to cover:
              Recursion tree & base cases =>> Backtracking pattern (choose → explore → unchoose)
    Why important: 
              Forms the mental base for DP, tree traversal, N-Queens, and permutations.
Key problems:
                        N-Queens
                        Subset generation
                        Rat in a maze / Path finding
