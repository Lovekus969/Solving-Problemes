What is a Graph in DSA?
    A graph is a data structure that consists of:
    Vertices (nodes) â†’ represent entities.
    Edges (links) â†’ represent relationships between nodes.

Formally, a graph is represented as:
                                 G = (V, E)
where:
        V = set of vertices
        E = set of edges

What is DFS (Depth-First Search)?

DFS is a graph/tree traversal algorithm.
It explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

DFS = exploring a maze by going as far as possible down one path before trying another.

BFS = exploring a maze layer by layer, like spreading outward in waves.
