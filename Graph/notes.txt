What is DFS (Depth-First Search)?

DFS is a graph/tree traversal algorithm.
It explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

DFS = exploring a maze by going as far as possible down one path before trying another.

BFS = exploring a maze layer by layer, like spreading outward in waves.
