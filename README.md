# Solving-Problemes
Here we will see some problems and try to solve them .
Todays problem is to get the target which comes most after its ket lets solve it 
i do use hasmap for this and i see how to use it 
i get all the vals in array and then put these val in hashmap by saying target and freqecy 
where as target is just next uindex to key run a loop get the key and the next one to it is just our target 
once we get the target just add it into the map 
use getorDefault method if its not there otheise increment in frequecy by default 
finally run a loop on the map by using entry set and get the val from the set with most frequency . 
this is the approch i use with comes with O(m+n) time complexity
