Welcome to solving-problems 
This repo is where I break down DSA concepts into small, digestible problems and solve them step by step — from recursion → memoization → tabulation → optimized solutions.

      Why This Repo?
                      To keep DSA practice organized
                      To learn patterns, not just solutions
                      To build FAANG-style problem solving skills in Java
