MISSION: MASTER DSA IN JAVA — WITH PERFECTION
Concept to master today 
Two Pointers and Sliding Windows 

 Quick Descriptions:
1️⃣ Climbing Stairs (k steps at a time)
You can take 1 to k steps at a time. How many ways to reach the top of n stairs?

✅ Use: Recursion → Memoization → Tabulation
🛠 Similar to: Dice Throw, Frog Jump, Min Steps to N

2️⃣ House Robber II
Same as House Robber I but now houses are in a circle.

✅ Use: Break into two subproblems: 0 to n-2 and 1 to n-1.
⛓ Test of handling circular array constraints in DP.

3️⃣ Max Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements
Given an array, return max sum of elements with no two adjacent selected.

🧠 Same logic as House Robber I.
✅ Use DP: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + dp[i-2])

4️⃣ Jump Game I & II
You are at index 0 and can jump arr[i] steps forward. Can you reach the end?


Why Use Java?
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
It has a large demand in the current job market
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It is open-source and free
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
