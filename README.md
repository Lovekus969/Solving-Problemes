Concept to Master Today
Two Pointers and Sliding Window
1Ô∏è‚É£ Climbing Stairs (k steps at a time)
You can take anywhere from 1 to k steps at a time. How many distinct ways are there to reach the top of n stairs?

‚úÖ Approach: Recursion ‚Üí Memoization ‚Üí Tabulation

üõ† Similar problems: Dice Throw, Frog Jump, Min Steps to N

2Ô∏è‚É£ House Robber II
Similar to House Robber I, but the houses are arranged in a circle.

‚úÖ Approach: Break into two subproblems: houses from index 0 to n-2 and from 1 to n-1

‚õì Key challenge: Handling circular array constraints in dynamic programming

3Ô∏è‚É£ Max Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements
Given an array, find the maximum sum of elements such that no two selected elements are adjacent.

üß† Logic mirrors House Robber I

‚úÖ DP formula: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + dp[i-2])

4Ô∏è‚É£ Jump Game I & II
Starting at index 0, you can jump up to arr[i] steps forward. Determine if you can reach the end of the array.
