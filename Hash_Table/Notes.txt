ðŸ”¹ What is a Hash Table?

        A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
        
        It uses a hash function to convert a key into an index in an array.
        
        This makes search, insert, and delete operations very fast (average O(1)).

Hash Table

        General data structure â†’ the concept itself.
        
        Stores data in keyâ€“value pairs using a hash function.
        
        Deals with collisions (chaining, open addressing).
        
        Can be implemented in any language (C, Java, Python, etc.).
        
        Not language-specific.

Hash Map

        A specific implementation of a hash table (mostly known from Java).
        
        In Java, HashMap<K, V> is a built-in class.
        
        Allows null keys and null values (HashTable class in Java does not).
        
        Not thread-safe (unless wrapped with synchronization).
        
        Provides many features like iteration over keys, values, and entries.
